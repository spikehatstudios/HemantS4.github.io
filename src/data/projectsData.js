    overview: 'Documentation doesn\'t have to feel like a chore. Momentum transforms the act of capturing ideas into a rewarding experience by combining gamification principles with AI assistance. Users face two major barriers: the task takes too long (78%) and there\'s no feedback (65%).

**User Barriers:**
• 78% say documentation takes too long
• 65% want immediate feedback while capturing ideas
• 82% are interested in AI and gamification features

The core issue: documentation feels like overhead. It interrupts the flow of thought. By the time users finish typing, they\'ve lost momentum. They need a tool that keeps up with their thinking—and rewards them for capturing it.`

        content: `I designed Momentum around Octalysis, Yu-kai Chou\'s gamification framework, prioritizing the drives that motivate documentation:

**High Priority (Motivate Effort):**
• Accomplishment (90%) – Every doc fragment feels like progress
• Empowerment (95%) – AI autocomplete and smart suggestions
• Ownership (85%) – Users organize and refine their own ideas

**Lower Priority (Avoid Negative Drives):**
• Social Influence (40%) – Optional sharing, not mandatory
• Loss Avoidance (20%) – No penalty for incomplete docs
• Scarcity (15%) – No artificial time pressure

The design emphasizes positive motivation: "You did that!" over "You\'re behind."`,

**Token Rewards:** Earn tokens for:
• Starting a doc (1 token)
• Adding tags or connections (1 token each)
• Completing a thought (3 tokens)
• Sharing with team (2 tokens, optional)

**Streaks & Milestones:** Visual progress showing consecutive days of capturing. Hitting 7, 30, and 100-day milestones unlocks customization rewards.

**Smart Organization:** AI learns your categories and automatically suggests where new ideas belong.`,

**The Busy Professional** – Needs quick capture with zero friction. Loves voice-to-text and AI-generated summaries.

**The Creative Dreamer** – Struggles with blank page syndrome. Benefits from prompts, mood tracking, and visual inspiration.

**The Overwhelmed Parent** – Wants to preserve memories without guilt. Thrives with auto-photo timelines and forgiveness for gaps.

**The Growth Seeker** – Tracks metrics obsessively. Drives streaks, progress reports, and visible achievement systems.

The design adapts to each persona while maintaining core mechanics that work universally: capture, organize, earn, reflect, personalize.`,

• **Automatic tagging** – Categorizes ideas without manual work
• **Connection detection** – Links related ideas across your knowledge base
• **Smart summaries** – Generates 1-line summaries for quick review

The AI never overwrites—it suggests. Users stay in control, which is critical for Empowerment (95% in Octalysis).`,

By combining **accomplishment** (tokens, streaks), **empowerment** (AI assists, you decide), and **ownership** (your rules, your structure), Momentum transforms documentation from a chore into a habit.

Research shows users with this combination engage 3x more than those using traditional tools.`

    overview: `I spent weeks watching kids with autism use motor-skill apps. Most apps were either too boring (clinical) or too chaotic (overstimulating). None adapted to individual needs. DP2 is my attempt to fix that: an AR game where kids pop bubbles, step on floor pads, and catch floating objects—while a friendly mascot mirrors their movements on-screen. Built on research with N=12 field observations, 15+ app reviews, and frameworks from OT/SLP experts. Still in development.`,

        title: 'The Gap I Found',
        image: 'Apps For ASD kids.png',
        content: `I reviewed 15+ apps for autistic kids. Most failed in the same ways: no adaptation (one-size-fits-all difficulty), sensory overload (flashing lights, loud sounds), or boring clinical interfaces. Kids with DCD (Developmental Coordination Disorder) need motor practice, but existing apps treat it like homework.

**What's missing:**
• Difficulty that adapts to each kid (not just "easy/medium/hard")
• Sensory controls (volume, brightness, contrast)
• Low-pressure format (mistakes don't punish, they inform)
• Something kids actually want to open

DP2 uses AR to make motor practice feel like play. Avatar mirrors your body (<150ms latency), so you see "I did that" immediately.`
      },
      {
        title: 'Research Method',
        image: 'Initial research.png',
        content: `I structured the research around four core questions:
1. Which motor skills to target first? (reach, balance, hand-eye coordination)
2. What sensory elements help vs. harm? (colors, sounds, visual clutter)
3. How to measure progress without burdening caregivers?
4. What session length actually works?

**What I did:** Observed 12 kids using existing apps, reviewed 15+ competitor apps, interviewed OTs and SLPs.

**What I learned:**
• Big, simple targets with warm sounds improve focus
• Familiar animation style (Disney/Pixar) encourages engagement
• 10–15 minute sessions with built-in breaks sustain engagement
• Avatar mirroring creates "I did that!" sense of agency
• Physical tokens work better than digital points`

        title: 'Design Principles',

        content: `Everything in DP2 follows four rules:

**1. Low Cognitive Load**
Same structure every session. One rule at a time. Predictable visuals and sounds. No surprises.

**2. Gradual Scaffolding**
Difficulty increases by ~10% only after two consecutive successes at 80%+ accuracy. Hit detection is generous (better to succeed than fail).

**3. Avatar Mirroring**
Your movement appears on screen in under 150ms. This creates "I did that!" moments—the kid sees cause and effect immediately.

**4. Privacy-First Data**
Tracks accuracy, reach height/distance, reaction time, L/R balance. Stored locally. Optional CSV export. Never used for diagnosis—only for adapting difficulty and showing progress.`

        content: `Each mechanic targets specific motor skills:

**🎈 Color Bubbles**
Pop bubbles that appear at different heights. Teaches reach range and targeting.

**👣 Trail Steps**
Step on left/right floor pads in sequence. Builds balance and bilateral coordination.

**🎯 Catch & Place**
Grab floating objects, match them to color-coded baskets. Hand-eye coordination and controlled force.

**🪞 Mirror Moves**
Mascot shows a pose, kid copies it. Body awareness and left/right mapping.

**🌙 Calm Cave**
Breathing fireflies for regulation breaks. Prevents overstimulation. Optional, kid-initiated.`

        image: 'Character Ref 2.png',
        content: `Autistic kids respond well to clear, expressive characters (think Pixar). So the mascot has big eyes, readable emotions, smooth shapes—nothing jagged or unpredictable.

**Sensory design:**
• Colors are bright but not harsh. High-contrast mode available.
• Warm voiceover, soft success sounds. No buzzers or fail noises. Volume + Quiet Mode.
• Optional gentle vibration on success (never on failure).

**Avatar tracking:**
Simplified skeleton—tracks reach direction, not finger precision. Kids don't need perfect form. The avatar mirrors intent, not perfection. That's how you preserve "I did that!" feeling without frustration.`

        content: `**Platform:** Unity 2022.3 + AR Foundation 5.x (iOS ARKit / Android ARCore). Targets iPad Pro/Air (2020+) and Galaxy Tab S7+.

**Motion Tracking:** MediaPipe Pose (33 skeleton landmarks at 30fps) → Kalman filter (smooths jitter) → Custom IK solver → Avatar animation. Total latency <150ms.

**Adaptive Difficulty:** ML.NET model adjusts target size/distance/speed based on rolling success rate (80% threshold = harder, 60% = easier).

**Data:** SQLite local storage. Optional CSV export for caregivers/therapists. COPPA-compliant, no cloud sync by default, PII stripped.`

        title: 'Design Philosophy',

        content: `I grounded DP2 in three frameworks:

**Octalysis (Gamification):** Tokens for effort (not perfection). Avatar gives instant "you did it" feedback. Optional "helping the world" narrative framing.

**Self-Determination Theory:** Autonomy (kid controls start/stop/skip), Competence (70–80% success rate keeps it in flow), Relatedness (mascot companion, not instructor).

**Neurodiversity-Affirming Design:** Built **with** input from autistic individuals and OTs, not just **for** them. Key principles: sensory controls = kid in charge, no forced eye contact, "Calm Cave" = regulation is valid, progress = capability growth (never "fixing" or "normalizing").

Field research: kids engage most when they feel in control. Pause anytime. Skip anything. Adjust all settings. Exit without penalty.`
